# BudgetBee ‚Äì Smart Money Management

**BudgetBee** is a open-source money management Android app, originally based on the now-archived **Ivy Wallet** project. Built with **100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**, BudgetBee helps you track your personal finances with ease while introducing powerful **AI-driven features** and continuous improvements.

Think of BudgetBee as an enhanced **manual expense tracker**, designed to replace traditional spreadsheets for managing your finances efficiently.

## üí° Do You Know? Ask Yourself:

‚úÖ **How much money do I have in total?**  
‚úÖ **How much did I spend this month, and where did my money go?**  
‚úÖ **How much can I spend while still meeting my financial goals?**

A money management app can help you answer these questions, and **BudgetBee** is here to do just that!

## üöÄ Why BudgetBee?

While **Ivy Wallet** was known for its **clean user interface, great experience, and customization options**, it lacked some features that many users needed. **BudgetBee** takes it a step further by:

‚úÖ Introducing **AI-powered finance insights**  
‚úÖ Adding **new and improved features** beyond Ivy Wallet  
‚úÖ Actively developing and improving the app with frequent updates

## üôå Acknowledgments

We recognize and appreciate the **original creators and contributors** of **Ivy Wallet** for laying the foundation of this project. Without their efforts, BudgetBee wouldn‚Äôt be possible. You can find the archived **Ivy Wallet repository here:**

**BudgetBee** is actively evolving, and we‚Äôre excited to bring even more features to enhance your finance management experience! üöÄ
